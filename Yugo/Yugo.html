          <h2>The brakeup of Yugoslavia</h2>
          <p>
            The Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s were a tragic series of conflicts
            leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fueled by ethnic tensions, wars erupted in Slovenia, Croatia,
            Bosnia, and Kosovo.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conflicts resulted in widespread violence, ethnic cleansing, and
            significant loss of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            International intervention, including the Dayton Agreement in 1995,
            brought an end to the Bosnian War, but the region remains scarred by
            the legacy of these conflicts, highlighting the challenges of
            managing diverse identities in the aftermath of political upheaval.

            <h2>Ethnic Rivalries</h2>
            <p>
              The breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s resulted in the creation of
              several independent states, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia
              and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of these nations faced unique challenges in establishing
              political stability and economic prosperity in the aftermath of
              the conflicts.

            <h2>Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the Yugoslav federation, the province of Kosovo was
              granted full autonomy in 1974, giving it almost the same rights as
              Yugoslavia's six republics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fifteen years later, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic proposed
              amendments to the Constitution of Serbia which would strip Kosovo
              of most of its autonomous powers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This prompted violent protests and on 3 March 1989 a state of
              emergency was declared, imposing direct rule from Belgrade over
              the province.

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              The Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s resulted from nationalism,
              declarations of independence by Slovenia and Croatia, and ethnic
              tensions exacerbated by Slobodan Milošević.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conflicts, including the Bosnian War, had profound
              humanitarian and geopolitical consequences in the Balkans,
              culminating in the Dayton Agreement in 1995.

            <h2>NATO intervention</h2>
            <p>
              NATO intervened in Yugoslavia in 1999 during the Kosovo War to
              stop ethnic cleansing by Yugoslav forces.
            </p>
            <p>
              The air campaign aimed to protect civilians in Kosovo. The
              conflict concluded with the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and the
              establishment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intervention, conducted without UN approval, remains a
              contentious episode in international relations.
