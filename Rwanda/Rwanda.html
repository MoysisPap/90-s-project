          <h2>Rwandan Genocide</h2>
          <p>
            The Rwandan genocide in 1994 witnessed the brutal killing of around
            800,000 people, mainly Tutsis, within a hundred days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Triggered by the assassination of President Habyarimana, ethnic
            tensions between Hutus and Tutsis erupted into widespread violence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite mounting evidence, international response, notably the UN,
            was inadequate. The aftermath left Rwanda deeply scarred, prompting
            ongoing efforts for justice and reconciliation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The genocide serves as a haunting reminder of the consequences of
            ethnic hatred and the imperative of preventing mass atrocities.

            <h2>Rwanda during the 90's</h2>
            <p>
              In the 1990s, Rwanda, located in East-Central Africa, was
              characterized by its hilly terrain and a growing population.
            </p>
            <p>
              The country, known as the "Land of a Thousand Hills," had a
              diverse climate due to its elevation. Rwanda was home to the
              Virunga Mountains, featuring volcanic activity and endangered
              mountain gorillas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The population was predominantly composed of Hutus and Tutsis,
              with ethnic tensions rooted in a colonial legacy. The capital,
              Kigali, saw some urbanization during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1990s were marked by the tragic Rwandan genocide, profoundly
              impacting the country's demographic and socio-political landscape.

            <h2>Juvénal Habyarimana Assassination</h2>
            <p>
              Juvénal Habyarimana was the President of Rwanda whose
              assassination on April 6, 1994, became the spark that ignited the
              Rwandan genocide.
            </p>
            <p>
              His death, in a plane crash near Kigali, remains a pivotal and
              contentious event. Habyarimana, a Hutu, had presided over a
              government marked by ethnic tensions and discriminatory policies
              against the Tutsi minority.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following his assassination, extremist elements within the
              Hutu-led government initiated a systematic and widespread campaign
              of violence against the Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

            <h2>The Genocide</h2>
            <p>
              The Rwandan genocide in 1994 saw the brutal killing of around
              800,000 people, mainly Tutsis, in just 100 days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Triggered by the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana,
              extremist elements within the Hutu-led government orchestrated
              systematic violence, targeting Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The international community faced criticism for its inadequate
              response. Rwanda, in the aftermath, pursued justice and
              reconciliation, trying perpetrators through the ICTR and national
              courts. The genocide's profound impact shaped Rwanda's trajectory
              in politics, society, and economics.

            <h2>Today Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              Today they have been repeated allegations that Rwanda has been
              backing the Tutsi-led M23 rebels, against their neighbor DRC,
              which Kigali has repeatedly denied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The force has seized swaths of territory in North Kivu, on the two
              countries border, since taking up arms again in late 2021 after
              years of dormancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It looks like the tensions never stops in Africa, the continent
              that has been suffered so much from bloody wars.
