          <h2>The Geopolitical view of the 90's</h2>
          <p>
            The geopolitics of the 1990s were defined by a series of
            transformative events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The collapse of the Soviet Union marked the end of the Cold War and
            ushered in a unipolar world order with the United States as the
            dominant superpower.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gulf War saw a coalition led by the U.S. pushing back against
            Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, highlighting the significance of oil
            resources in global politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yugoslav Wars and the subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia into
            multiple states raised complex questions about ethnic conflicts and
            international intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simultaneously, the Rwandan Genocide shocked the world, underscoring
            the challenges of preventing mass atrocities and shaping the
            doctrine of the "responsibility to protect."
          </p>
          <p>
            These events collectively reshaped the global landscape and continue
            to influence geopolitics today.

            <h2>Soviet Union Collapse</h2>
            <p>
              The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s marked the end of a
              geopolitical era.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internal economic struggles, political discontent, and a desire
              for independence among various Soviet republics culminated in the
              formal dissolution of the Union in 1991.
            </p>
            <p>
              This event not only ended the Cold War but also reshaped global
              power dynamics, leaving the United States as the preeminent
              superpower and paving the way for the emergence of newly
              independent states in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

            <h2>The Gulf war</h2>
            <p>
              Gulf War in the 1990s was a pivotal conflict triggered by Iraq's
              invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
            </p>
            <p>
              A coalition led by the United States intervened to repel the Iraqi
              forces, emphasizing the global importance of stabilizing the
              oil-rich Gulf region.
            </p>
            <p>
              The war showcased the effectiveness of international cooperation,
              as a diverse coalition of nations united against aggression.
              Operation Desert Storm, the military campaign to liberate Kuwait,
              demonstrated the strategic significance of maintaining stability
              in the Middle East.

            <h2>The breakup of Yugoslavia</h2>
            <p>
              The Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s were a series of conflicts that led
              to the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethnic and nationalist tensions erupted, resulting in a complex
              web of wars, including the Croatian War, the Bosnian War, and the
              Kosovo War. The breakup of Yugoslavia was characterized by
              atrocities, mass displacement, and humanitarian crises.
            </p>
            <p>
              The international community's response was marked by the
              intervention of organizations like the United Nations and NATO,
              reflecting the challenges of managing ethnic conflicts and
              humanitarian disasters in a post-Cold War world.

            <div class="main_Rwanda_img"></div>
            <h2>Rwandan genocide</h2>
            <p>
              The Rwandan Genocide in the 1990s stands as one of the darkest
              chapters in human history.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1994, ethnic tensions between the majority Hutu and minority
              Tutsi populations erupted into widespread violence and mass
              killings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The international community's response was marred by inaction, and
              within a span of a few months, hundreds of thousands of Rwandans
              were brutally murdered. The genocide highlighted the catastrophic
              consequences of ethnic hatred and underscored the urgent need for
              effective international intervention to prevent such atrocities.
